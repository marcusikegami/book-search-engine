## Description 

This project is a fully functional book search engine that uses Google's Book API to search for books using a search query. The back end was originally set up following RESTful API construction to allow a user to create an account and save/delete books. The starter code was changed to use ApolloServer and ApolloClient along with GraphQL, changing the way the client interacts with the server. Currently a work in progress.

## Installation

Clone the repo to the working directory on your machine. In GitBash or a similar CLI run the command npm install to install all packages in the client and server package.json files. If that was successful, run the command 'npm run develop' to start the servers for both the front and back end. If that was sucessful, The application should open in your default browser.

## Usage

This software is intended to be used to find books using simple search queries and to save books to the User's account. The application is currently a work in progress.
